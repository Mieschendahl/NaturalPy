# Examples

This directory contains examples that demonstrate how *NaturalPy* can be used.

All of the examples use *ChatGPT* as the LLM implementation, although this can be changed by importing your own LLM implementation into the examples and replacing the imports from `gpt.py`.

## Setup

1. Install *OpenAI* and *NaturalPy*.

```bash
pip install --upgrade openai git+https://github.com/Mieschendahl/NaturalPy.git
```

2. Set your [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

3. Run an example.

```bash
python3 example_<ID>.py
```

⚠️ **Warning**: *NaturalPy* executes code generated by LLMs, that means **it should only be executed in secure environments**!
